* save recorded waveforms from memory. data for each channel is saved as string of unsigned chars. supports saving multiple records and all visible channels.

* save and restore current setup. (some settings sadly cannot be saved, like channel labels)

* scripts to convert dumped channel data to wave and sigrok format, thus making downloaded data analyzable in e.g. pulseview

## Extra devices

In lack of a better place I also keep my other screenshot scripts here.
Those are for real GPIB device (IEEE 488) from other vendors that I have:

 * HP 53310a Modulation Domain Analyzer
 * LeCroy LC574AL Ocsilloscope

## Dependencies
